## Exercise: Shape Area Calculator

#### Description:
Write a Java program that calculates the area of different shapes using method overloading.

#### Shapes to Calculate Area for:
1. Circle
2. Rectangle
3. Triangle

#### Instructions:
1. Create a method named `calculateArea` that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter and returns the area of the circle. (Formula: Area = Math.PI * radius * radius)
2. Overload the `calculateArea` method to take the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and return the area of the rectangle as a decimal number. (Formula: Area = length * width)
3. Overload the `calculateArea` method to take the base and height of a triangle as parameters and return the area of the triangle as a decimal number. (Formula: Area = 0.5 * base * height)
4. In the `main` method, call each of the overloaded `calculateArea` methods with appropriate arguments and print the results.
